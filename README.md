In this project, two(2) dataset is been provided, testing and training dataset.
ensemble model is used in the project to check the accuracy of the model. 
before the development of model, concatenation is been done on both the training and testing set where 75% was giving to training set and 25% for testing after the concatenation..
The model used for the project are listed below 
1. Gradient boosting
2. stacking classifier
3. bagging classifier
4. voting classifier
This are the ensemble machine learning model used for the project..
some of the ensemble models have a base model( means different supervised machine learning models combined together to result to ensemble models)
some of the base models include
1. randomforest classifier
2. logistics regression .

The accuracy for each models include 
Gradient boosting  = 0.91 
bagging classifier =0.96
stacking classifier =0.96 
voting classifier =0.72
